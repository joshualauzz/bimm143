Reading the file into R
```{r}
dat = read.table('rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt')
```

### Q13

Sample size for each genotype

```{r}
table(factor(dat$geno))

```

Median expression for each genotype
```{r}
dat %>% 
  group_by(geno) %>%
  summarize(median = median(exp))
```

### Q14
```{r}

boxplot(exp~geno, dat)
```
From the boxplot, we see that the genotype AA has the highest expression of ORMDL3 with a median of ~30, and that the genotype GG has the lowest expression of ORMDL3 with a median of ~20, with the heterozygous genotype AG in between with an expression of ~25. This would seem to indicate that the SNP in ORMDL3 affects the expression of the protein.
